## The Canticle of the Dragon (Epic Poem)

*This is the central prophecy poem of the Dragonlance saga, recited by sages and bards across Krynn.*

The poem tells the complete history of Krynn in verse:
- **Verse 1 (Age of Dreams):** Dragons made war on the world of Krynn
- **Verse 2 (Huma's Rise):** A knight of Solamnia called down the gods and forged the Dragonlance
- **Verse 3 (Huma's Victory):** Huma followed the light to the Khalkist Mountains, crushed the darkness
- **Verse 4 (End of Age of Dreams):** Paladine shone at Huma's side; the Queen of Darkness was banished
- **Verse 5 (Age of Might):** Istar arose, kingdom of light and truth, where minarets of white and gold spired to the sun
- **Verse 6 (The Kingpriest's Folly):** The Kingpriest of Istar saw shadows, searched for the paths of Huma, sought to purge the world of sin
- **Verse 7 (The Cataclysm):** A mountain of fire crashed like a comet through Istar; the city split like a skull in the flames
- **Verse 8 (Age of Despair):** Roads tangled, winds and sandstorms dwelt in husks of cities. We called to the blank sky, into the cold dividing gray. The sky is calm, silent, unmoving — we have yet to hear their answer

**Usage in Campaign:** This poem is commonly performed by bards and sages. Player characters who succeed on a DC 12 History check would have heard portions of it. The final verse serves as a hook — the "answer" the world awaits is the return of the true gods, which the Heroes of the Lance will bring about.

His punishment: guard the Hammer of Kharas in Derkin's Tomb until an ancient prophecy is fulfilled — "When the power of the gods returns, then shall the hammer go forth to forge the weapons of the righteous"
- **Personality:** Peaceful poet and dreamer. World-weary but amused by heroes' struggles. Loves beauty and has adorned Derkin's Tomb with magical creations of art, light, and music. Enjoys confusing people by polymorphing into different forms when unobserved
- **Polymorphed Forms:** "Kharas" (most common — poses as the legendary dwarf), Serinda (beautiful elven maiden), galeb duhr, eagle, pony-sized dog, Aghar (gully dwarf), piniculus. If attacked by tomb robbers, assumes wemic form but retains gold dragon stats

- **Notable:** Toede demands the Blue Crystal Staff on behalf of "Onyx" (the black dragon Khisanth). When refused, orders his hobgoblins to attack and then flees. If "killed," make his death obscure — he returns later in the saga

## Dream Cards (Nightmare Sequences)

- Realizes striking a golden lock will free Elistan and destroy Verminaard forever
- But Kitiara cries for help, sorely beset by draconians
- **Torn between duty and love** — hesitates, and is killed by a draconian's spear
- Last sight: Kitiara dying at draconian hands

### Sturm's Dream
- Battle against draconians. A huge blue dragon appears — only he can defeat it
- **Fear stabs his heart.** He knows confronting the dragon means death
- Turns away, shaking and ashamed. The wall is breached
- Trampled by draconians, dies a coward — bitterly despairing

### Goldmoon's Dream
- Fights her own murdered Que-Shu tribespeople (now undead draconians)
- Tears run down her cheeks as she cuts down people she loved
- Shatters the glass case to free Elistan — but Elistan's eyes become cold

### Riverwind's Dream
- Fights murdered Que-Shu tribespeople alongside Goldmoon
- Sees Goldmoon fighting toward Elistan as their own tribesmen stab her
- Legs grow heavy — can't reach her no matter how hard he tries
- Watches Goldmoon fall, mortally wounded by her own people

### Laurana's Dream
- Endless draconian hordes. Sturm falls beside her
- **Voices demand she take command.** Everyone calling her name for help
- She doesn't want to help — wants to be told what to do
- Throws down weapons and runs into growing darkness, unable to stop

### Tasslehoff's Dream (and other Rogues)
- Only he can free Elistan! The lock is childishly simple
- But it resists his best techniques. Friends dying around him
- Hands bleed from tearing at the lock in bitter frustration
- Triggers a simple trap he knew was there — **poisoned needle, quest doomed**

### Raistlin's Dream (and other Wizards)
- Magic has never been stronger. Victory at hand!
- Vision: himself in black robes, feared and powerful. The Book of Magius open before him — all magical knowledge
- Looks at companions: "How pitiful they look; how doomed!"
- **Strides through the door. Red robes turn black**

### Caramon's Dream
- Fights alongside brother Raistlin. Fearless, unstoppable together
- Friends fall one by one. Then the protective spell dissipates
- **Raistlin, now in black robes, abandons him for Verminaard**
- Stabbed in the back by an unseen killer. Last thoughts: his brother, forever lost to evil

- Sees a draconian's back — stabs deeply — **realizes too late it was Caramon**

- Identical to Goldmoon's dream — calls on True Gods, fights, despairing
- Shatters glass case. Elistan becomes cold, tears away amulet
- Elistan's white robes turn scarlet, disappears with Verminaard

**DM Usage Notes:**
- Read dream cards privately to each player
- Dreams foreshadow real events and character arcs (Raistlin's turn to evil, Sturm's confrontation with a dragon, Laurana's growth into leadership)
- Dreams cause no damage but impose emotional weight
- Can trigger character development roleplay moments

- They ARE however insatiably curious, which often puts them in MORE danger than fear would
