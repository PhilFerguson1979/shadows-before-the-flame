## Key Locations (DL5-DL14)

### Tarsis the Beautiful (DL7)
- **Status:** Fallen trade city, under dual dragonarmy assault
- **Key Event:** The Red and Blue Dragonarmies attack simultaneously — Red from betrayal of a neutrality pact, Blue pursuing the heroes specifically
- **Critical Decision:** Party must choose: go with Derek Crownguard to Icewall for the Dragon Orb, OR go with Alhana Starbreeze to Silvanesti
- **Aftermath:** Citizens blame the Knights of Solamnia for the destruction, deepening hatred of the Knighthood
- **Governor:** Remained behind believing his social status would protect him. He was wrong

### Icewall Region (DL5-6)
- **The Tundra:** Forbidding wasteland between Tarsis and the glacier. Lord Derek leads the group south along the Old Coast Road
- **Zeriak Village:** Ice barbarian settlement led by Galeswept. The White Highlord has ordered it looted. Heroes can defend the village and gain a guide
- **The Wall of Ice:** Icewall Glacier must be climbed in 3 stages (or 2 with Galeswept's path). Each stage requires DC 15 STR (Athletics) check; failure = 1d10 falling damage and retry
- **Icereach:** Frozen plain atop the glacier. Encounters: ice bears, remorhaz, thanoi
- **The Ice Ship:** Harald Haakan's ski-mounted flagship. White-dragon-shaped prow. Ice Folk crew. Strict hierarchical society — violence answers most transgressions
- **Ice Mountain Bay:** Ship graveyard in the South Sirrion Sea. Dozens of ships with dead crews trapped in ice since the Cataclysm. Vallenwood ships are still seaworthy (1-14 days to free). Guarded by 15 thanoi

### Icewall Castle (DL6)
- **Description:** Stone castle completely covered in packed snow and ice — appears as an odd ridge crest. Only a single narrow brick tower reveals its true nature
- **Entry:** Via hidden ravine (with Harald's help) or heroes' own ingenuity
- **Key Feature:** Houses the Dragon Orb of Icewall
- **Guardian:** Sleet, the White Highlord's old white dragon

### Palanthas (DL8)
- **Description:** Greatest city on the continent. Built like a great wheel with 8 concentric circular roads and 8 great avenues radiating from Central Plaza
- **Split:** Old City (government, mansions, Great Library, Tower of High Sorcery) within walls; New City (residences, University, Temple District, Merchandising District) outside
- **Attitude:** Palanthians are aloof and condescending. Believe their city is the Jewel of Solamnia. Unconcerned about the war — trust the Tower of the High Clerist to protect them. Only 2 in 10 citizens offer any cooperation
- **Lord Amothus:** Palanthas's ruler. Generous but naive — believes a nonaggression treaty with the Dark Queen is possible
- **Knight's High Road:** Only land route out — runs across the Vingaard Mountains to the Tower of the High Clerist
- **Boons from Lord Amothus (d10):**
  1. Letter of introduction
  2. Free ship passage
  3. 100 gold pieces
  4. 100 steel pieces
  5. One nonmagic weapon per hero
  6. One magic item
  7. Trained war-horse per hero
  8. One veteran city guard
  9. Battalion of city guards
  10. One magic item per hero

### Whitestone Council (DL8 — Critical Political Event)
- **Location:** Sancrist Isle, Castle uth Wistan
- **Participants:** Representatives of all free races of Ansalon
- **The Climax:** The Council devolves into squabbling over control of the Dragon Orb. Fizban, fed up, hurls the Orb against the Whitestone, shattering it. The assemblage erupts in fury — a lynch mob forms
- **The Dragonlance Revelation:** From the back of the crowd, Theros Ironfeld (one-armed blacksmith with the Silver Arm of Ergoth) steps forward. "For the past several weeks I have been forging these, with the help of a dwarf wise enough to bring the Hammer of Kharas." He thrusts a glittering dragonlance into the ground. The vote to unite against Evil is unanimous
- **Aftermath:** Gunthar sends heroes to either Palanthas/High Clerist Tower, or to Foghaven Vale to find Huma's lost shrine and rediscover dragonlance forging secrets

### Kalaman (DL11-12)
- **Status:** Trade city occupied by the Blue Dragonarmy
- **City Layout:**
  - **Castle Kalaman:** Blue Lady's quarters when in residence. Lord Calof (surviving noble) serves as puppet ruler
  - **Barracks (4 buildings):** Goblins/hobgoblins, human soldiers, ogre infantry, draconians — 500 beings each
  - **Poor District:** Thieves' guild, taverns, houses of ill repute. Drunken soldiers roam the streets
  - **Business District:** Open-air market nearly rivals Palanthas. Weapons forbidden (death penalty for merchants). Cartographer Ashe Mer-Kame has secret passage maps
  - **Secret Passage:** Through south wall — known only to kender of the Stoat Clan (and their close friends)
- **Blue Lady's Behavior:** When Kitiara returns, she walks the streets cutting down anyone in her way. After a few days of terror, she and Skie depart for Dargaard Keep to cement her alliance with Lord Soth
- **Liberation:** Whitestone Army forces and Good dragons eventually assault the city

### Neraka (DL14)
- **Description:** Barren plain high in the Khalkist Mountains of central Ansalon. Bleak, stark city built around the Temple of Darkness
- **Undercity:** Ancient sewer system beneath Neraka. Stocked with giant slugs by Emperor Ariakas to discourage infiltration. Random encounters: vermin, thieves, skeletons, slugs
- **Emperor's Treasure (Ariakas's hoard in the Undercity):**
  - Coins: 100,000 sp, 80,000 gp, 40,000 ep, 50,000 stl, 10,000 pp
  - Gems: 10,000 gems worth 30-300 stl each
  - Magic items: Plate mail +4, shield +4, shield +3, chainmail +4, leather armor +3, longsword +5 defender, mace +4, sword +2 (red dragon slayer), dwarven thrower hammer +3, cursed berserking sword +2, dust of disappearance, dust of sneezing and choking, gem of seeing, medallion of ESP

### Temple of Darkness (Final Dungeon)
- **Origin:** When the Cataclysm struck, the Temple of the Kingpriest of Istar was scattered among all planes of the gods. The Foundation Stone — studded with precious gems including a piece of the Whitestone — was cast into the Abyss, Takhisis's realm. She used it as her portal back to Krynn. The Stone was planted in Neraka and slowly, magically grew into a dark, twisted version of the original Temple
- **Structure:** Dungeon level → Main temple level → Upper levels → Council Chamber → Temple Tower
- **Dungeon Level:** Dark Abbey (worship area for Dark Pilgrims), army treasuries organized by draconian type, scriptoriums
- **Main Level:** Twisting corridors of bizarre, grown (not built) architecture
- **Council Chamber:** Where all five Highlords gather
- **Temple Tower:** Individual Highlord apartments:
  - Green Highlord (Salah-Khan): Incense and intoxicants
  - White/Black Highlords: Chaotic, filthy quarters
  - Red Highlord (Ariakas): Trophy collection including a silver dragon's head
  - Blue Highlord (Kitiara): Military, organized, practical
- **The Foundation Stone:** The gate through which Takhisis enters Krynn. A hero must enter the gate with a true dragonlance to seal it, barring Takhisis from Ansalon. The hero who seals the gate is trapped on the other side — this is a one-way trip
- **Nightly Balls:** Sequence of balls hosted by each army (White, Green, Black, Red) — dancing, officers' gatherings, political intrigue before the final council

## The Silvanesti Nightmare (DL10 — Unique Dream System)

*The most unique and complex encounter system in the Dragonlance saga. When Lorac Caladon attempted to use the Dragon Orb to save Silvanesti, the green dragon Cyan Bloodbane corrupted his mind. The entire kingdom became a waking nightmare.*

### Rules of the Dream
- **Geography Changes:** The landscape shifts and warps. Roads lead to unexpected places. The forest bleeds
- **Dreamshadows:** Heroes who "die" in the Nightmare don't truly die — they are replaced by Dreamshadow versions of themselves. The real hero is trapped elsewhere in the dream and must be rescued
- **Time Distortion:** Time does not pass normally in the Nightmare. Days may pass outside while only hours pass within, or vice versa
- **Everything Radiates Magic:** The entire region detects as magical. Standard detection spells are useless for identifying specific enchantments
- **Illusions:** Not all threats are real, but some certainly are. Heroes must learn to tell the difference

### Cyan Bloodbane's Method
- Cyan Bloodbane, a venerable green dragon, does not fight the heroes directly at first
- Instead, he feeds Lorac's nightmares through the Dragon Orb, causing the land itself to attack
- The Bleeding Woods: Trees weep blood, branches grasp at travelers, the forest floor tries to swallow heroes
- Victory requires reaching Lorac and breaking the Orb's hold on him — not defeating the dragon in combat

---

## Mass Combat Notes (DL11 — Dragons of Glory)

The war campaign allows heroes to influence the outcome of the War of the Lance through strategic decisions:
- Heroes' actions in various cities (Kalaman, Palanthas, etc.) affect the strength of the Whitestone Army
- Alliances forged (Ice Folk, rebels, dragons) provide additional forces
- The final liberation of Kalaman serves as the turning point of the war

---

## Kitiara's Gambit (DL14 — Key Roleplaying Encounter)

At Neraka, Kitiara contacts the Whitestone Army general, offering to defect:
- Claims she wants to discuss her future now that the war is turning against her
- Wants a midnight meeting in a grove southeast of the city
- **The Truth:** She has no intention of defecting. Plans to kidnap the general as a hostage
- **Kitiara's Profile:** "Although Kitiara may not be very wise, she has a keen military mind, and she is paired with one of the greatest tacticians in all of Ansalon — the blue dragon Skie. He too has been analyzing the heroes"
- Heroes must serve as bodyguards. Kitiara can "circumvent almost anything they design"

## The Foundation Stone & Takhisis's Return (Campaign Climax Mechanics)

### The Prophecy
The campaign builds toward a single moment: Takhisis fully manifesting through the Foundation Stone gate. Heroes must:
1. Infiltrate the Temple of Darkness
2. Navigate past Highlords, draconians, and the assembled might of the Dragon Empire
3. Reach the Foundation Stone
4. One hero must enter the gate with a true dragonlance — sealing it and trapping themselves on the other side

### Multiple Paths to Victory
- **Stealth:** Disguise as dragonarmy soldiers, use the Undercity tunnels
- **Alliance:** Accept Kitiara's offer (knowing she'll betray them) and use the double-crossing to their advantage
- **Force:** With enough dragonlances and allied dragons, fight through the Temple
- **The Novel Solution:** In the Chronicles trilogy, Berem (the Green Gemstone Man) enters the gate, reuniting with his sister Jasla's trapped spirit. The gate seals. Raistlin facilitates this, betraying Takhisis and surrendering himself to Fistandantilus's spirit. The Temple crumbles. Kitiara finds Ariakas's Imperial Crown in the rubble
