## Core Rules

### The Basic Rule
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, roll a **d20**, add modifiers, and compare to a target number:
- **Ability Check:** d20 + ability modifier (+ proficiency if proficient)
- **Attack Roll:** d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus
- **Saving Throw:** d20 + ability modifier (+ proficiency if proficient)

### Proficiency Bonus by Level

| Level | Prof Bonus | Level | Prof Bonus |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | +2 | 11 | +4 |
| 2 | +2 | 12 | +4 |
| 3 | +2 | 13 | +5 |
| 4 | +2 | 14 | +5 |
| 5 | +3 | 15 | +5 |
| 6 | +3 | 16 | +5 |
| 7 | +3 | 17 | +6 |
| 8 | +3 | 18 | +6 |
| 9 | +4 | 19 | +6 |
| 10 | +4 | 20 | +6 |

### Advantage & Disadvantage
- **Advantage:** Roll 2d20, take the higher
- **Disadvantage:** Roll 2d20, take the lower
- Multiple sources don't stack — if you have both, they cancel out

### Difficulty Classes (DC)

|----------------|-----|
| Very Easy | 5 |
| Easy | 10 |
| Medium | 15 |
| Hard | 20 |

## Spellcasting Rules

### Spellcasting Ability
- **Spell Save DC** = 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier
- **Spell Attack Modifier** = proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier

### Spell Components
- **V (Verbal):** Spoken words — can't cast if silenced
- **S (Somatic):** Hand gestures — need at least one free hand (or War Caster feat)
- **M (Material):** Physical components — can use component pouch or arcane focus instead (unless component has a GP cost or is consumed)

### Spell Slot Rules
- Casting a spell "expends" a slot of that level or higher
- Cantrips don't use slots — castable at will
- Casting a spell at a higher slot level often increases its effect ("upcasting")
- Spell slots regain on long rest (except Warlock: short or long rest)

### Prepared vs Known Casters

| Type | Classes | How Spells Work |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Prepared** | Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard, Artificer | Know full class list (or spellbook for Wizard). Each long rest, choose which spells to prepare. Prepared count = ability mod + level (or half level for half casters). Domain/Oath spells always prepared. |
| **Known** | Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Ranger | Fixed list of spells known. Can swap 1 spell per level-up. All known spells are always "prepared." |

### Concentration
- Only one concentration spell active at a time
- Taking damage: CON save DC = 10 or half damage (whichever is higher) — fail ends spell
- Being incapacitated or killed ends concentration
- Can voluntarily end concentration at any time (no action)
- Environmental effects (DM discretion) may require concentration checks

### Ritual Casting
- Spells tagged "ritual" can be cast without spending a slot — takes 10 extra minutes
- **Who can ritual cast:** Bard (must know the spell), Cleric (must have it prepared), Druid (must have it prepared), Wizard (must have it in spellbook — does NOT need to be prepared)
- Ritual Caster feat: ritual cast from a book
- Pact of the Tome with Book of Ancient Secrets: ritual cast from any class list

### Bonus Action Spells
- If you cast a spell as a bonus action, the only other spell you can cast that turn is a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action
- This applies even if you haven't cast the bonus action spell yet (e.g., can't Action spell then Bonus Action spell)

### Combining Magical Effects
- Effects of same spell don't stack — use the most potent/recent
- Different spells DO stack (e.g., bless + shield of faith)

### Spell Schools

| School | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Abjuration | Protection, banishing, blocking, warding |
| Conjuration | Summoning creatures, creating objects, teleportation |
| Divination | Revealing information, detection, seeing the future |
| Enchantment | Mind-affecting, charm, compulsion |
| Evocation | Energy manipulation, damage, healing |
| Illusion | Deception of senses, creating false images |
| Necromancy | Life force manipulation, undead, death energy |
| Transmutation | Changing matter and energy, transformations |

---

## Combat Rules

### Combat Sequence
1. **Determine surprise:** DM decides if any combatants are surprised (compare Stealth vs Passive Perception)
2. **Roll initiative:** d20 + DEX modifier for each combatant
3. **Take turns:** Each round = 6 seconds. Turns proceed in initiative order.

### Your Turn — Available Actions

**Action (choose one):**

- **Cast a Spell:** One spell with casting time of 1 action
- **Dash:** Double your movement speed for this turn
- **Disengage:** Movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks this turn
- **Dodge:** Attacks against you have disadvantage, advantage on DEX saves (until start of your next turn, ends if incapacitated or speed drops to 0)
- **Help:** Give an ally advantage on their next ability check or attack roll vs one creature within 5 ft
- **Hide:** Stealth check to become hidden
- **Ready:** Prepare an action with a trigger (uses your reaction when triggered; readied spells require concentration and use the slot even if not triggered)
- **Search:** Perception or Investigation check
- **Use an Object:** Interact with a second object or use an item requiring an action

**Bonus Action (if you have a feature that grants one):**
- Two-weapon fighting: off-hand attack (no ability mod to damage unless you have TWF style)
- Class features: Cunning Action (Rogue), Rage (Barbarian), Bardic Inspiration, etc.
- Bonus action spells (healing word, misty step, spiritual weapon, etc.)

**Reaction (one per round):**
- Opportunity attack: melee attack when creature leaves your reach
- Readied action trigger
- Class features: Shield spell, Counterspell, Uncanny Dodge, etc.

**Free Interactions (once per turn):**
- Draw or sheathe one weapon
- Open a door
- Pick up a dropped item
- Other simple interactions

**Movement:**
- Move up to your speed (can split between attacks)
- Standing from prone costs half your movement
- Moving through difficult terrain costs 2 ft per 1 ft moved
- Moving through ally's space: allowed (can't stop there unless they're 2+ sizes different)
- Moving through enemy's space: not allowed (unless 2+ sizes different)

### Attack Rolls
- **Melee:** d20 + STR mod + proficiency (or DEX if finesse)
- **Ranged:** d20 + DEX mod + proficiency (or STR if thrown)
- **Natural 20:** Automatic hit + critical hit (double all damage dice)
- **Natural 1:** Automatic miss
- **Critical Hit:** Roll all damage dice twice (including sneak attack, smite, etc.)

- Don't add ability modifier to bonus attack's damage (unless you have Two-Weapon Fighting style)

### Mounted Combat
- Mount acts on your initiative (controlled mount can only Dash, Disengage, or Dodge)
- If mount is forced to move, rider makes DC 10 DEX save or falls prone

- Ranged attacks: auto-miss beyond normal range; disadvantage within normal range (unless crossbow, net, or weapon thrown like javelin)
- Creatures fully submerged in water: resistance to fire damage

### Death and Dying
- **0 HP:** Fall unconscious and start making death saving throws
- **Death Saves:** d20 at start of each turn — 10+ = success, 9 or below = failure. 3 successes = stabilize. 3 failures = death. Natural 20 = regain 1 HP. Natural 1 = 2 failures.
- **Instant Death:** Damage exceeding your max HP remaining after reaching 0 = instant death
- **Stabilizing:** Medicine check DC 10, or spare the dying cantrip. Stabilized creature is at 0 HP but not making saves; regains 1 HP after 1d4 hours.

- **Qualinesti Elves:** High elves of western Ansalon, more open to other races
- **Silvanesti Elves:** Ancient, isolationist high elves of eastern Ansalon
- **Kagonesti Elves:** Wild elves of the forests
- **Hill Dwarves (Neidar):** Surface-dwelling dwarves
- **Mountain Dwarves (Hylar, Daewar):** Underground city of Thorbardin
- **Dark Dwarves (Theiwar, Daergar):** Evil-aligned dwarven clans
- **Kender:** Small, fearless, "accidentally" sticky-fingered halfling-like race (unique to Krynn)
- **Gnomes (Tinker Gnomes):** Inventive, chaotic, machines that usually malfunction
- **Minotaurs:** Organized, honor-bound bull-people with their own island nation
- **Gully Dwarves (Aghar):** Dim-witted, downtrodden dwarves

### Knights of Solamnia
Krynn's premiere knightly order, following the Oath and the Measure:
- **Order of the Crown:** Loyalty and obedience — entry order
- **Order of the Sword:** Courage and heroism — martial focus
- **Order of the Rose:** Wisdom and justice — highest order
- **Motto:** "Est Sularus oth Mithas" ("My Honor Is My Life")

### Mages of High Sorcery
- All arcane magic users on Krynn must take the Test of High Sorcery or be hunted
- Three orders based on moon alignment: White (Good), Red (Neutral), Black (Evil)
- The Test is dangerous — failure often means death
- Renegade mages (who refuse the Test) are hunted by all three orders
