## Session Highlights

### Session 1 — The Inn of the Last Home
- Got his **shortsword stuck** in the heavy Vallenwood table mid-combat
- Failed an intimidation attempt on **Hederick** by accidentally ramming his own sword hilt into his stomach
- **Failed most of his attack attempts** despite his impressive Dexterity — the dice were not kind
- **Nearly died** before the Monk intervened and saved him
- A rough debut, but survived to steal another day
