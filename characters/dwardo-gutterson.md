## Personality

> *Friendly and curious.*

Dwardo embodies the classic Kender spirit — endlessly curious, disarmingly friendly, and completely fearless. He wanders into danger with a smile, pokes at things he probably should not, and somehow makes friends (and enemies) everywhere he goes. His Kender nature means he has a loose concept of personal property.

## Session Highlights

### Session 1 — The Inn of the Last Home
- **Sleep** spell misfired and put **innocent bystanders** to sleep instead of the guards
- **Vicious Mockery** on Sergeant Hagar proved highly effective — dealt **3 psychic damage** and imposed **disadvantage** on Hagar's next attack
- Attempted to **springboard off a stuck sword** to reach the rafters, hit the ceiling, and was **knocked unconscious** on a rafter
- Ended the session at **1 HP** — barely alive
- The chaotic energy everyone expected from a Kender Bard
