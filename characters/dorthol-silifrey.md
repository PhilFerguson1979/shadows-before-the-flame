## Session Highlights

### Session 1 — The Inn of the Last Home
- Cast **Grease** to control the battlefield but slipped on a cup and missed — greased the wall instead
- After Cogmaw killed Sergeant Hagar with grease + fire (Hagar fell dead on a table, setting it ablaze), Dorthol threw **water on the grease fire** — causing an **explosion** that damaged party members
- Took **6 fire damage** from misdirected flames
- Learned a valuable lesson about water and grease fire interactions
