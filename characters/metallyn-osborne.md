## Personality

> *Collects rumors. Gladiator.*

Metallyn Osborne is a former gladiator who has never lost her love for spectacle and combat. She collects rumors the way others collect coins — always listening, always filing away information for later use. In battle she is ferocious, direct, and not always precise about where her weapons end up.

## Session Highlights

### Session 1 — The Inn of the Last Home
- **Critically failed** her axe throw and **lodged it in Cerci Sanja's back** for **11 damage** (the session's worst friendly fire incident)
- Used her **mace to bash Sergeant Hagar** over the head for **7 damage**, going into a **fit of Rage** doing it
- Rage granted damage resistance for the rest of the fight
- Took **4 damage** from Hagar's hammer and **3 damage** from the grease fire explosion
- Ended the session **covered in flour** — a fitting image for a chaotic first outing
