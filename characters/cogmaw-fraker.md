## Personality

> *Wants to know how things work.*

Cogmaw Fraker is driven by a deep mechanical curiosity. Every lock, every device, and every contraption is a puzzle begging to be understood. Where others see tools, Cogmaw sees engineering marvels waiting to be disassembled, studied, and rebuilt — ideally with improvements.

## Session Highlights

### Session 1 — The Inn of the Last Home
- **Stabbed Hederick** for **4 damage** in melee — not afraid to get close
- Cast a stone at **Sergeant Hagar's helmet** for **6 damage** using ranged attacks
- Delivered a **killing blow** on a guard with a stone launched straight through the eye
- **Killed Sergeant Hagar** — grabbed grease from the wall, threw it in Hagar's face, and lit him on fire with his **fire bolt invention**. Hagar fell dead on a table, setting it ablaze and triggering the grease fire incident
- The most **consistent performer** of the session — reliable damage every round
