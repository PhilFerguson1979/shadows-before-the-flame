## Appearance

A slender, almost frail figure draped in crimson robes. His most striking features are deeply unsettling: his skin has an unnatural **metallic gold** sheen, and his eyes contain **hourglass-shaped pupils** that seem to measure everything they fall upon. He watches the world around him with a stillness that makes the air feel heavier.

## What We Know

Raistlin is a companion of **Caramon Majere** (likely his brother, given their shared surname) and part of the group that includes **Tanis**, **Goldmoon**, and **Riverwind**. He was present at the **Inn of the Last Home** during Session 1 but said little -- observing everything with that unnerving, calculating gaze.

Whatever the source of his unusual appearance, it marks him as someone touched by powerful magic.

## Session 1 Events

- Present at the inn during the confrontation with Hederick and the bar fight.
- Did not speak to the party directly.

## Relationship to Party

Unknown. Not yet formally introduced. His unsettling presence makes him difficult to read.
