**Location:** [Solace](../locations/solace.md)
**First Encountered:** Session 1

---

## Appearance

A pompous, drunken zealot with an oily voice and greedy eyes. He carries himself with the self-important bluster of a man who believes his authority is absolute -- and the desperate aggression of one who knows it is borrowed.

## What We Know

Hederick holds the title of **High Seeker of Solace**, a religious authority figure in the city. The Seekers present themselves as spiritual leaders, but Hederick's behavior revealed a far darker truth.

### What He Revealed Under Interrogation

After the party defeated his guards, Hederick was interrogated and confessed the following:

- The **Dragon Army pays the Seekers** to confiscate magical items and relics from the populace.
- The Seekers **sell people into slavery** on behalf of the Dragon Army.
- Seekers travel from **city to city**, keeping towns under control and compliant until the Dragon Army arrives in force.
- He invoked the name **Lord Verminaard** -- apparently a figure of authority within the Dragon Army.

## Session 1 Events

- **Stormed into the Inn of the Last Home** with a squad of guards and **Sergeant Hagar**, demanding the confiscation of **Goldmoon's Blue Crystal Staff**.
- **Shoved Tika Waylan** when she tried to intervene.
- His actions triggered a violent bar fight.
- **All of his guards were killed** during the fight. **Sergeant Hagar was killed by an arrow.**
- Was **captured and interrogated** by the party, during which he revealed the Seeker-Dragon Army conspiracy.
- Was **left alive** but thoroughly humiliated and looted of his possessions.

## Relationship to Party

**Hostile.** Hederick is a corrupt authority figure whose forces attacked the party. He was defeated, interrogated, and stripped of his belongings. He is unlikely to forget or forgive this humiliation.
