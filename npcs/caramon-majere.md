---

## Appearance

A massive, powerfully built man -- easily one of the largest people in any room he enters. He has a booming laugh and an appetite to match his frame. Despite his intimidating size, he radiates warmth and good humor. He appears to be the brother or close companion of **Raistlin Majere**.

## What We Know

Caramon was at the **Inn of the Last Home** eating spiced potatoes by the fireplace when the party arrived. He is clearly a fighter of considerable strength and seems to travel with the group that includes **Tanis**, **Raistlin**, **Goldmoon**, and **Riverwind**.

## Session 1 Events

- Was enjoying Otik's famous spiced potatoes by the hearth.
- When **Hederick shoved Tika Waylan**, Caramon responded by **throwing Hederick bodily into his own guards** -- a display of raw strength that left little doubt about his combat capability.

## Relationship to Party

Not yet formally introduced, but his actions during the bar fight put him clearly on the side of the inn's defenders.
