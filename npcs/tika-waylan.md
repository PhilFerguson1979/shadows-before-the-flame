## Appearance

A young woman with a wild mane of curly red hair and eyes full of weary fire. She moves through the inn with quick, practiced steps -- clearly someone who has worked hard her whole life and doesn't back down easily.

## What We Know

Tika works as the barmaid at the **Inn of the Last Home** under **Otik Sandath**. Despite her youth, she carries herself with a toughness that suggests she has seen more than her share of trouble. She is brave, resourceful, and fiercely protective of the inn and its people.

## Session 1 Events

- Was **shoved by Hederick the High Seeker** when she tried to intervene during his confrontation at the inn.
- After Cogmaw killed Sergeant Hagar with grease and fire (causing Hagar to fall dead on a table, setting it ablaze) and Dorthol made it worse by throwing water on the grease fire, **Shoto called out for help**. Tika responded instantly — **saved the Inn of the Last Home from burning down** by smothering the fire with flour bags. Without her quick action, the entire Vallenwood tree could have gone up in flames.

## Relationship to Party

Tika proved herself an ally through her actions. She stood up to Hederick at personal risk and saved the inn while the party fought off the Seeker's guards.
