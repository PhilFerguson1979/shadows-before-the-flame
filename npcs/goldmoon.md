## Appearance

A regal woman with the bearing of someone born to lead. She carries herself with quiet dignity and appears to hail from the plains. Her most notable possession is a **staff of blue crystal** that catches and refracts the firelight in mesmerizing patterns.

## What We Know

Goldmoon was present at the **Inn of the Last Home** alongside **Riverwind**, who stands guard beside her with fierce protectiveness. She is also part of the larger group that includes **Tanis**, **Caramon**, and **Raistlin**.

Her **Blue Crystal Staff** drew the attention of **Hederick the High Seeker**, who attempted to seize it by force -- triggering the bar fight that engulfed the inn.

## Session 1 Events

- Hederick specifically targeted her, attempting to **confiscate the Blue Crystal Staff**.
- The confrontation over her staff was the catalyst for the entire bar fight.
- Did not formally speak to the party.

## Relationship to Party

Not yet formally introduced. The significance of the Blue Crystal Staff -- and why Hederick was so desperate to take it -- remains unclear.
