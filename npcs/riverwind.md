## Appearance

A towering plainsman with a powerful build and an expression carved from stone. He radiates protective fury, standing always at **Goldmoon's** side like a living shield. His eyes are watchful and hard -- this is not someone who trusts easily.

## What We Know

Riverwind accompanies **Goldmoon** and appears deeply devoted to her safety. He is part of the group that includes **Tanis**, **Caramon**, and **Raistlin**. Like Goldmoon, he appears to be from the plains, far from the Vallenwood trees of Solace.

## Session 1 Events

- Present at the inn during Hederick's attack and the bar fight.
- Remained close to Goldmoon throughout the confrontation.
- Did not speak to the party directly.

## Relationship to Party

Unknown. Not yet formally introduced. His guarded demeanor suggests earning his trust will take time and action, not words.
