## Appearance

A stout, round-shouldered man with a friendly but worried face. Almost always seen wearing a flour-dusted apron. His hands are thick and calloused from decades of cooking and tending bar.

## What We Know

Otik Sandath is the longtime proprietor of the **Inn of the Last Home**, Solace's most beloved gathering place. He is known across the region for his legendary **spiced potatoes** -- a recipe he guards closely and serves to every table.

Otik knew our fallen friend **Ispin Greenshield** and had been entrusted with a letter and personal effects to deliver to us. He held them faithfully until our arrival.

## Session 1 Events

- Delivered **Ispin's final letter** and the **Robe of Useful Items** to the party upon our arrival at the inn.
- When **Hederick the High Seeker** stormed in with his guards, Otik moved quickly to evacuate innocent patrons from the inn during the ensuing fight.
- Remained behind to protect his establishment alongside **Tika Waylan**.

## Relationship to Party

Otik is a friend and ally. He honored Ispin's trust by safeguarding his final message for us. He showed courage in a dangerous moment by putting the safety of his patrons first.
