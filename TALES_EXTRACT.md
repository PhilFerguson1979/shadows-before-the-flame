- **Climate:** Hot summers (late Corij to early Reorxmont), perfect for grain. Rain in downpours with sultry stretches between. Heavy snowfalls in winter (H'rarmont to Chislmont) — Sentinel Gap often snows closed, cutting Solace off from Haven.
- **Trade:** Barbarians trade corn, furs, horses, feathers, woven blankets, pottery, wari hide. Seeker Lands specialize in smithing, ale, weapons, armor, hospitality. Barbarians journey to Solace for weapons/armor and Qualinesti leather.

- **Politics:** Tentative alliance with Kern (ogres to the north). Occupied by Green Dragonarmy (Kern by Red). Strengthening ties with Khur nomads and Sanction pirates.
- **Trade:** Very little — ogres trade only with those they can't pummel. Brutal haggling ritual: both parties sit across a table with daggers embedded in tabletop. Buyer tosses coins toward seller, seller slides object toward buyer. If either double-crosses or quits too early, knives come out — fight to the death. Trade goods: pork, shale, clay, coal, lizards. Merchants pay 10 stl per ogre head for caravan escort.

#### Silvanesti — Pre-War Detail
- Founded 3350 PC by patriarch Silvanos who drove out the dragons
- Unlike dwarves who carved from stone, Silvanesti elves shaped living trees and granite into their city
- Capital Silvanost is creation of elves and nature together — oldest surviving city on Ansalon
- In 2192 PC the Kinslayer War erupted between elves and humans; lasted 100+ years, ended with Swordsheath Scroll
- Dispossessed western elves demanded new homeland — became the Qualinesti
- Wounded Silvanesti raised a hedge around the main forest to keep outsiders away, growing increasingly isolationist
- **Bleeding Wood:** After 349 AC dragon attack, King Lorac wielded Dragon Orb — it controlled him instead, his nightmares twisted the forest into a hideous form. Cracked/rotting trees, gnarled roots, ooze-filled Than-Thalas River, Tower of Stars became a withered spire.
- **Current State:** Elves established thick hedge around Silvanesti to ward off anyone. Climate matches ruined state — blizzards, floods, overwhelming summer decay smell.

Dwarves never retire — only take up simpler work.
- **Saying:** "A good chair may outlast a good friend"
- **Cultural Note:** Dwarves hide their passion around "big folk" — therefore seem inscrutable, coarse, and reticent. But their choruses sing at the top of their lungs. Tender oboe, harp, or pipe can bring them to their knees.

| **Theiwar** | Mountain | CE | Pale, light-sensitive | Evil dwarves dwelling in darkness. Savant Realgar (Megalomaniacal) represents them. |

| **Aghar** (Gully) | Surface | Varies | See Gully Dwarves section | Crossbreed outcasts |
| **Zakhar** | Mountain | NE | Disfigured by mold plague | "Cursed ones" in old Thoradin halls. Kill outsiders on sight. |

### Gully Dwarves (Aghar) — Complete Racial Profile

#### Appearance
- Crossbreed of outcast dwarves and humans — not true dwarves
- Shorter than standard dwarves, rounder, perpetually dirty
- Life in filth and squalor gives them a distinctive odor

#### Personality Traits (The Seven Hallmarks)
1. **Survival:** Above all else, gully dwarves survive. Their talent for groveling, hiding, and fleeing keeps them alive against all odds.
2. **Pride:** Despite their lowly station, gully dwarves maintain fierce pride in their clans and accomplishments (however modest).
3. **Innumeracy:** Cannot count above 2 — "1, 2, many" is their number system. Anything more than two = "lots" or "whole bunches."
4. **Cheerfulness:** Irrepressibly cheerful in the face of adversity. Their optimism borders on delusion.
5. **Clannishness:** Intensely loyal to their clan. Clans are named after their Highbulp (leader/chief).
6. **Cunning:** Despite low intelligence, gully dwarves possess animal cunning that aids survival.
7. **Gluttony:** Will eat anything — absolutely anything. Their iron constitutions allow them to digest what would sicken other races.

#### Gullytalk
- Unique language mixing corrupted Common, Dwarvish, and gully dwarf inventions
- Grammar is minimal — mostly nouns and verbs with few modifiers
- Example expressions: "Me find!" "Pretty thing!" "You give!" "Whole bunches!"

#### Religion
- Worship ancestor spirits and "holy objects" (random junk held when something good happened)
- Shamans cast "spells" using somatic/material components: running under low obstacles, blowing pepper in faces, breaking grease pots
- High Priestess Bupu of the Bulp Aghar: Shaman 1st level, Str 15, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 10. Famous for giving Raistlin the spellbook of Fistandantilus.

#### Gaming Notes (5e Adaptation)
- **Ability Score Adjustment:** Roll special dice — use 2d6 for STR, INT, WIS, CHA; use 3d6 for DEX, CON
- **Lifespan:** Shorter than standard dwarves (exact range not specified, estimated 50-150 years)
- **Special Ability:** Groveling — enemies must make WIS save DC 10 or feel too disgusted/amused/pitying to attack for 1 round

### Elven Subraces of Krynn — Complete Details

#### Silvanesti (High Elves)
- Oldest and most noble elven race, descended from Silvanos
- Light skin, fine features, typically dark or silver hair

#### Qualinesti (High Elves)
- Descended from western Silvanesti who were displaced after the Kinslayer War
- Slightly more tan than Silvanesti, more varied hair colors
- More open to other races but still proud

- Caught between two worlds — too elven for humans, too human for elves
- The Kinslayer War was partly caused by tensions over half-elves
- During that war, half-elves were forced to choose sides, brother fighting brother

#### Elven Personality Traits
- **Shaping:** Elves reshape the world to match their ideal — gardens, buildings, creatures, society
- **Foresight:** Long lives give elves perspective that shorter-lived races lack. They plan in centuries.
- **Pride:** All elven races possess deep pride, though it manifests differently (Silvanesti = isolationism, Qualinesti = noblesse oblige, Kagonesti = fierce independence)
- **Hedonism:** Elves embrace beauty and pleasure — art, music, wine, love. Life should be savored.

#### Elven History Key Dates
- **4000 PC:** First Sinthal-Elish (elven council). Silvanos unified elf families. Balif became lieutenant.

### Wizards of High Sorcery — Complete Details

#### The Three Foundations of Wizardry
1. All wizards are brothers in their order. All orders are brothers in the power.
2. The places of High Wizardry are held in common — no sorcery used there in anger against fellow wizards.
3. The world beyond the walls may bring brother against brother and order against order — such is the way of the universe.

#### The Test of High Sorcery

### Holy Orders of the Stars — Priesthood System

#### The Three Orders
- **Order of Good:** Led by Chosen Prophet (priest of Paladine) + 6 Prophets (one per other Good god)
- **Order of Evil:** Led by Nightlord (priest of Takhisis) + 6 Nightmasters

- **No clerics** as in standard D&D — all priests serve a specific god

## Gods of Krynn — Avatar Stat Blocks

*When gods walk Krynn, they take avatar form. These stats represent their mortal avatars, not their true divine power. All avatars have legendary resistances (3/day) and can cast divine spells at will.*

### Creation Myths (Unique to Each Race)
- **Silvanesti Version:** The gods sang the world into being; Paladine shaped the land, Mishakal breathed life into it, and Takhisis tried to corrupt the song

- **Gnomish Version:** The world is a great machine built by the gods; gnomes were created to maintain and improve it (they argue about the improvement part)

## Krynn Currency Exchange Rates

*After the Cataclysm, steel replaced gold as the standard currency.*

| Coin | vs Copper | vs Silver | vs Steel | vs Platinum |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Copper (cp)** | 1 | 1/5 | 1/100 | 1/500 |
| **Silver (sp)** | 5 | 1 | 1/20 | 1/100 |
| **Gold (gp)** | 2 | 1/2 | 1/40 | 1/200 |
| **Iron/Bronze (ip)** | 50 | 10 | 1/2 | 1/10 |
| **Steel (stl)** | 100 | 20 | 1 | 1/5 |
| **Platinum (pp)** | 500 | 100 | 5 | 1 |

**Key Difference:** Gold is nearly worthless on Krynn except for ornamentation. Steel is the primary trade currency because it's needed for weapons and tools in the war-torn continent.
