### The Oath and the Measure — Complete Details

The Knights of Solamnia are governed by two sacred texts:

**The Oath:** "Est Sularus oth Mithas" — "My Honor Is My Life"
- Every Knight must recite this at dawn and whenever challenged
- Breaking the Oath is grounds for immediate expulsion and loss of all rank

**The Measure:**
- A 37-volume legal code governing every aspect of a Knight's life
- Written by Vinas Solamnus and expanded by subsequent Grand Masters
- Each volume covers a specific domain: combat protocols, diplomatic conduct, chain of command, treatment of prisoners, religious observance, etc.
- The Measure is so detailed it has become a bureaucratic burden — Knights spend more time interpreting the Measure than acting
- **Key Tension:** Strict adherence to the Measure vs. practical necessity is the central conflict among the Knights during the War of the Lance
- Derek Crownguard represents rigid adherence; Sturm Brightblade represents the spirit of honor over the letter of the law

**Specific Measure Excerpts from DL8:**
- "A Knight shall not raise arms against a fellow Knight except in formal challenge or in defense of the Oath"
- "The chain of command must be respected in all matters military; orders flow from Grand Master to High Clerist to Lord to Knight"
- "Surrender is permitted only when continued resistance would result in the death of innocents under the Knight's protection"
- "A Knight of the Rose may countermand orders of a Knight of the Sword or Crown when matters of honor are at stake"
- The Measure specifies exact procedures for: declaration of war, siege protocols, treatment of prisoners, diplomatic immunity, conduct during truces, dueling codes, succession of command

**Events of Honor (Morale System):**
The Knights' effectiveness in battle depends on their collective morale, which is tracked as a numerical rating that rises and falls based on PC actions:

| Event | Morale Effect |
|-------|--------------|
| PCs discover the Dragon Orb | +2 |
| PCs use Dragon Orb to lure dragon to its death | +3 |
| Yarus is freed and joins the battle | +5 |
| Virkhus is freed and his legions join | +5 |
| Knights charge (Event of Honor) | -5 (reckless glory-seeking) |
| Each 10% Solamnic casualties | -1 cumulative |
| Each 10% Dragonarmy casualties | +1 cumulative |
| Dragons spotted in the skies | -2 |

Starting morale depends on how well the PCs have united the fractious Knight commanders. Base morale begins at 5 (out of a possible 22+).

### The High Clerist Tower — Complete Description

The Tower of the High Clerist is the greatest fortress on Ansalon, guarding the Westgate Pass — the only land route between the Solamnic Plains and Palanthus. Built in the Age of Dreams by Vinas Solamnus himself, its defensive mechanisms are so ancient that even the Knights who garrison it don't fully understand them.

**Physical Layout:**
- **Curtainwall:** A massive outer wall surrounding the central keep, with battlements at medium altitude (120 ft)
- **Inner Towers:** Eight tall towers rising to high altitude (240 ft), connected to the curtainwall by arched walkways
- **Main Gates:** Multiple gates of magical ironwood (extremely durable)
- **Trapped Archways:** The walkways connecting curtainwall to inner towers can be collapsed by defenders, blocking access between courtyards
- **Interior Defenses:** Knights inside the tower proper gain exceptional defensive advantages from the ancient architecture

**Key Interior Locations:**

**The Dragon Trap (Encounter 32):**
- The tower's greatest secret weapon — a chamber designed specifically to lure and destroy dragons
- When combined with a Dragon Orb, dragons can be summoned through a narrow passage into a killing chamber
- This mechanism is what ultimately saves the tower during the siege

**The Eternal Halls (Encounters 36-42):**
- A magical maze of teleporting corridors deep within the tower
- Doors connect rooms in non-Euclidean ways — entering one door may exit in a completely different part of the tower
- Originally designed as a defensive labyrinth to confuse invaders
- Contains the remains of ancient defenders and their treasures

**The Treasury (Encounter 50):**
- Contains 156,450 steel pieces (stl) — the accumulated wealth of the Solamnic Knights
- Guarded by ancient magical wards
- Also contains historical artifacts and records of the Knights

**The Khas Room (Encounter 55):**
- A chamber containing the great Khas board of Lord Yarus
- The board is 3 feet across, made of finest carved ivory inlaid with polished blue and cream marble
- Pieces are intricately crafted blue and cream granite
- The unfinished game between Yarus and Kurnos has kept hundreds of souls trapped as spectral minions for centuries
- Completing the game (or breaking the curse) frees the trapped souls

**The Crown Chamber:**
- The three pieces of the Crown of Yarus are scattered throughout the tower
- Some under guard, others in forgotten rooms
- Only by reuniting the Crown can Yarus be freed to finish the game

---

### Yarus, Kurnos, and the Khas Game — Backstory

**Lord Yarus** was a Knight Commander of the High Clerist Tower at the time of the Cataclysm. When the fiery mountain struck Istar, the shockwaves reached even the Westgate Pass.

**The Story:**
- On the night of the Cataclysm, Yarus was playing Khas (Krynn's version of chess) with his friend Kurnos
- A massive earthquake struck the tower; a falling pillar killed Kurnos instantly and shattered Yarus's crown into three pieces
- Yarus himself was trapped — the unfinished game and the magic of the Crown bound his soul and the souls of everyone in the tower
- Hundreds of Knights, soldiers, servants, and visitors became spectral minions — ghosts unable to rest because the game was never completed
- Yarus can only return to the world and finish the game if someone reassembles his Crown
- If the PCs free Yarus and he finishes the game, his legions join the defense of the tower (+5 morale)

**Kurnos** became an undead entity as well — trapped in endless rage at his death. His spectral form haunts the Khas Room.

**The 33rd Khas Piece:**
- Legend tells of a 33rd piece on the Khas board — a piece that doesn't belong to any normal game
- This piece represents the wild card of fate itself
- Its significance is tied to the resolution of the Cataclysm-era curse

**About Khas (the Game):**
- Krynn's equivalent of chess, played across all civilized nations
- Uses blue and cream pieces on an ivory and marble board
- Legends say a Khas game reflects battles currently being fought somewhere in the world
- Great battles have supposedly been won or lost because of a Khas game being played elsewhere
- This mystical connection is what makes Yarus's unfinished game so dangerous — it binds real souls

---

### Virkhus and the Legion of Virkhus

**Commander Virkhus** was a Knight who served under Yarus at the time of the Cataclysm.

- When the Cataclysm struck, Virkhus was leading a patrol in the hills south of the tower
- He and his entire company were killed in the upheaval
- Their spirits rose as undead — but unlike the spectral minions inside the tower, Virkhus's legion retained their martial discipline and sense of duty
- They haunt the "Hills of Virkhus" south of the High Clerist Tower
- If the PCs can communicate with Virkhus and convince him that a righteous battle is being fought, his entire legion will join the defense
- The Legion of Virkhus is an extremely powerful undead army: AC -2 (5e equivalent: AC 22), variable HD, 20% magic resistance, morale 19 (unbreakable)

**5e Conversion — Virkhus:**
- **Type:** Undead (Revenant Knight)
- **CR:** 10

- **Damage Immunities:** Poison
- **Condition Immunities:** Charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned
- **Senses:** Darkvision 120 ft, passive Perception 13
- **Undead Fortitude:** When reduced to 0 HP, makes CON save (DC 5 + damage taken). On success, drops to 1 HP instead.
- **Marshal Undead:** Undead allies within 30 ft add Virkhus's CHA mod (+4) to attack rolls
- **Multiattack:** Three attacks with spectral greatsword
- **Spectral Greatsword:** +9 to hit, 2d6+5 slashing plus 2d6 necrotic damage

### Crown of Yarus (Artifact)

**5e Conversion:**
- **Type:** Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)
- **Description:** Made of intricately laced polished steel fitted with diamonds (worth 10,000 gp assembled)

  - **Command Undead:** The wearer can command spectral minions within the High Clerist Tower (no save). This is necessary to free Yarus.

  - **Turn Undead (enhanced):** The wearer can Turn Undead as a 15th-level Cleric, 3/day
  - **Commune with Dead:** Can cast Speak with Dead at will while in the tower
- **Curse:** Anyone who puts on the assembled Crown must make a DC 17 CHA save or become obsessed with completing the Khas game, ignoring all other priorities until the game is finished or the Crown is removed (requires Remove Curse or Greater Restoration)

- **Incorporeal Movement**
- **Non-Combatant:** Philosophers do not attack. They exist to communicate.

- **Incorporeal Movement**
- **Non-Combatant (mostly):** Searchers only attack if cornered or if a creature tries to take an object the Searcher is focused on.

- **Ghostly Grasp:** +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, 2d6+3 necrotic damage. Used only in self-defense.

- **Destruction:** If the Fetch is destroyed, there is no further consequence. If the Fetch kills its target, the target cannot be resurrected by any means short of a Wish spell.
- **Behavior:** Fetches appear in the High Clerist Tower as echoes of the Cataclysm's magical disruption. They typically appear as duplicates of PCs, approaching from a distance and attacking when close.

The original module includes a Simplified Battle Resolution system for DMs not using BATTLESYSTEM miniatures rules. Adapted to 5e:

**Step 1 — Determine Knight Morale (base 5-22+)**
Use the Events of Honor table above to track morale.

**Step 2 — Apply Modifiers:**
| Modifier | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Previous Dragonarmy losses (per 10%) | +1 cumulative |
| Dragon Orb used to kill dragon | +3 (also negates dragon penalty) |
| Virkhus's Legion joins | +5 |
| Yarus freed and joins | +5 |
| Previous Solamnic losses (per 10%) | -1 cumulative |
| Dragons in the skies | -2 |
| Knights charge recklessly | -5 |

**Step 3 — Roll 1d6 + Modified Morale:**

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| 4 or less | **Tower Falls (Heavy Losses):** Dragonarmy overruns defenses. Knights take 50% unrecoverable losses, driven from tower. |
| 5-6 | **Tower Falls (Moderate Losses):** As above but 35% losses. |
| 7-8 | **Tower Falls (Light Losses):** Knights retreat with only 25% losses. |
| 9-12 | **Barely Hold (Losses):** Knights hold the wall but lose 10% of forces. Morale unchanged. |
| 13-14 | **Barely Hold (Minor Losses):** Hold with only 5% losses. |
| 15 | **Hold (Losses):** Knights defend valiantly, lose 10% but morale holds. |
| 16 | **Hold (Minor Losses):** Defend with only 5% losses. |
| 17 | **Hold (No Losses):** Perfect defense, no casualties. |
| 18 | **Repel (With Losses):** Drive Dragonarmy back, but lose 10%. Minor victory, morale +1. |
| 19-20 | **Repel (No Losses):** Drive them back with no losses. Morale +1. |
| 21 | **Repel and Damage Enemy (Minor):** Dragonarmy retreats with new respect. No appreciable enemy losses. Morale +2. |
| 22-23 | **Repel and Damage Enemy:** As above but 5% Dragonarmy losses. |

**Recovering Casualties:**
- Only 1/3 of "killed" or routed units are actually dead
- The remaining 2/3 are disorganized and can be recovered between battles
- This means the Dragonarmy can take heavy beatings in early sorties and still have plenty of fight for the final battle

### Siege Sortie Schedule

The battle is fought in multiple waves (sorties):

**Sortie 1 — "The Juggernaut Comes" (Battle of Firstblood):**
- 5th Blue Flight probes defenses with kobold and draconian advance
- Tests for weak points; breaks off if 4+ units rout or any unit takes 25% casualties
- DM objective: scare the players, show the threat is real

**Sortie 2 — "Battle of the Clerist Wall":**
- Full assault — 5th and 6th Blue Flights commit all forces
- Kobolds hasted by Bozak draconians advance as cannon fodder
- Draconian archers provide suppression while assault units scale walls
- Dragons conduct drop assaults — flying over walls, dropping draconians behind defenders
- Dragonarmy retreats if 50%+ units are routed/destroyed (100+ figures)

**Sortie 3 — "Knights Breakout":**
- Triggered when Knight morale reaches 8+ or PCs take the field
- Knights sally forth from the tower to engage Dragonarmy in the Hills of Virkhus
- Dragonarmy has hidden reserves in the hills (4th Army west, 5th Army east, 8th Army + Reaper south)
- Objective: crush the Knights' offensive

**Sortie 4 — "Battle of the Reaper" (Final Battle):**
- All remaining forces committed on both sides
- Lord Soth's Reaper cavalry and Marantha's death chariots enter the fight
- Dragonarmy presses until 50% of forces routed/destroyed
- If PCs completed the tower quest (freed Yarus, used Dragon Orb), this is a winnable fight
- If PCs failed, the tower falls and Palanthus is lost

### Additional Unique Content — Siege Warfare Rules

**Tower Defensive Mechanisms (5e adaptation):**
- **Trapped Archways:** Defenders can collapse the walkways connecting curtainwall to inner towers as an action, blocking passage and dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures below (DEX DC 15 for half)
- **Dragon Trap:** A hidden chamber that can be combined with a Dragon Orb to lure and kill dragons. The dragon must squeeze through a narrow passage and is trapped in a killing zone with no room to fly. Defenders above rain attacks with advantage.
- **Interior Defense Bonus:** Knights fighting from inside the tower proper gain +5 to AC (three-quarters cover) and attackers suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls against them due to murder holes, arrow slits, and narrow passages.
- **Magical Ironwood Gates:** Each gate has AC 19, 70 HP, damage threshold 10, and is 75% resistant to magic (treat spells as having a 75% chance of simply failing against the gate material)

**Wall Scaling Rules:**
- Grappling hooks: Can be thrown and climbed in 1 round. Only 1 creature per rope at a time. Creatures on grapples have disadvantage on attack rolls.
- Ladders: Take 1 round to place, 1 round to climb. Only 1 creature per ladder at a time. Creatures on ladders have -2 to attack rolls.
- Defenders can push ladders away (1 action, no attack that round)
- Grapple ropes can be cut as a bonus action if no enemy is currently climbing

**Draconian Gliding:**
Draconians can glide from heights, covering 4x the launch height in horizontal distance:
| Launch Height | Glide Distance |
|--------------|---------------|
| 30 feet (low) | 120 feet |
| 120 feet (medium) | 480 feet |
| 240 feet (high) | 960 feet |

This allows assault draconians to launch from dragon-back at altitude and glide onto the tower walls, landing behind defenders for devastating surprise attacks.

**Draconian Drop Assault:**
- Dragons fly over walls carrying 10 draconians (1 figure) at a time
- Draconians can land in front of or behind defenders
- Landing behind: Attack rolls have advantage (rear attack) but don't disengage defenders from wall
- Landing in front: No advantage but force defenders to disengage from wall defense

**Wall Breach:**
- Curtainwall: 100 damage to create a 30-foot breach
- Keep wall or gates: 50 damage to breach
- Magical ironwood gates: 70 damage to break
- Stone is 75% magic resistant
- Ogres can attempt to breach walls with sustained battering
