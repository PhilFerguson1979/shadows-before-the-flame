# The Seekers

A false religious order that has seized power across parts of Krynn in the absence of the true gods.

## What We Know

The Seekers present themselves as a legitimate religious authority — priests and leaders guiding the people in a world where the old gods have gone silent. In reality, they are **tools of the Dragon Army**, using their position to:

- **Confiscate magical items** and artifacts under the guise of religious law
- **Sell people into slavery** to fund the Dragon Army's war effort
- **Maintain control** over towns like Solace through fear and false piety

## Hederick the High Seeker

The party's first encounter with the Seekers was **[Hederick the High Seeker](../npcs/hederick.md)**, the Seeker authority in Solace. He:

- Stormed the Inn of the Last Home with armed guards
- Declared the party heretics
- Attempted to seize the Blue Crystal Staff
- Was defeated, captured, and interrogated by the party

Under interrogation, Hederick revealed the Seekers' connection to the Dragon Army and their role in the slave trade.

## Seeker Law

In Seeker-controlled areas:
- Possessing unapproved magical items is considered heresy
- The Seekers claim authority over all religious matters
- They employ armed guards to enforce their decrees
- Resistance is met with accusations of heresy and force
