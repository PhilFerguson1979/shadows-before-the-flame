# The World of Krynn

Krynn is the world in which our adventure takes place — a land shaped by the wars of gods and dragons, where ancient magic lingers and darkness stirs once more.

## What We Know

Krynn is a world that has known great ages of light and terrible ages of darkness. The gods once walked among mortals, but after a great cataclysm centuries ago, the gods withdrew from the world. Temples fell. Clerics lost their power. The people of Krynn were left to fend for themselves.

In the absence of the true gods, **false religions** like the Seekers rose to fill the void — promising hope but delivering only control.

Now, whispers of **dragons** returning after centuries of absence have begun spreading across the land. Our fallen friend Ispin Greenshield believed that a sealed darkness was breaking free, and that artifacts of light would be needed to stand against it.

## Key Regions

| Region | What We Know |
|--------|-------------|
| **Abanasinia** | The region where Solace is located. Currently under Seeker occupation. |
| **Solace** | A treetop city built in Vallenwood trees. Our adventure began here. |

## The Cataclysm

Centuries ago, a great Cataclysm struck Krynn. The details are murky — old stories say the gods punished the world for the hubris of a powerful king. A fiery mountain fell from the sky, reshaping the land. Seas appeared where there were none. Cities were destroyed. The gods went silent.

Since then, true divine magic has been all but lost — until the appearance of the **Blue Crystal Staff**, which seems to channel genuine healing power.

## The Moons

Krynn has **three moons**, each tied to one of the orders of magic:
- **Solinari** (silver) — White Robes (good-aligned magic)
- **Lunitari** (red) — Red Robes (neutral magic)
- **Nuitari** (black, invisible to most) — Black Robes (dark magic)

The moons influence the power of wizards who follow the orders. Raistlin Majere, the mage the party has encountered, wears Red Robes.
