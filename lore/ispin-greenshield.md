# Ispin Greenshield

A seasoned adventurer and trusted friend whose parting words set us on the path we now walk.

## What We Know

Ispin Greenshield was a trusted friend and ally to the members of our party. Before his death, he learned of a terrible threat rising in the world and took steps to warn those he trusted most.

He entrusted **[Otik Sandath](../npcs/otik-sandath.md)** at the Inn of the Last Home with:
- A **sealed letter** addressed to the party
- A **Robe of Useful Items** — his final gift

## The Letter

Ispin's letter warned of:

- A strange *pulling* in the world, as if time itself were being forced backward by unseen hands
- A Shadow reaching out from an Abyss thought long sealed
- **Artifacts of ancient light** that must be found and protected before they fall into the wrong hands
- A fragile peace that may not hold — and the need for those he trusted to stand against what is coming

## Legacy

Ispin could not be here to fight the darkness himself, but his foresight and his trust in us may prove to be the spark that lights the flame of resistance. His Robe of Useful Items continues to serve the party, and his warning guides our path forward.

## Unanswered Questions

- How did Ispin die?
- How did he learn about the rising darkness?
- What specific artifacts was he referring to?
- Did he have allies beyond our party who are also working against the threat?
