# The Three Moons of Krynn

Krynn has three moons, each tied to one of the orders of magic. Their cycles influence the power of wizards and shape the tides of arcane energy across the world.

## The Moons

| Moon | Color | Alignment | Orbit | Effect |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Solinari** | White/Silver | Good | 36 days | Powers the White Robes — magic of protection and healing |
| **Lunitari** | Red | Neutral | 28 days | Powers the Red Robes — magic of balance and illusion |
| **Nuitari** | Black (invisible) | Evil | 8 days | Powers the Black Robes — magic of destruction and shadow |

## High Sanction

When a moon reaches its fullest and brightest phase — called **High Sanction** — the magic tied to that moon becomes most powerful. Wizards of that order gain their greatest strength during these nights.

- **Solinari** remains in High Sanction for approximately 5 days
- **Lunitari** is in High Sanction for 3-4 days each month
- **Nuitari** enters High Sanction roughly once a week due to its fast orbit

## The Night of the Eye

When all three moons reach High Sanction simultaneously, it is called the **Night of the Eye**. During this rare event, magic becomes nearly uncontrollable and the sky bleeds red and white with a void of black where Nuitari hangs invisible.

## The Invisible Moon

**Nuitari** is invisible to most people — only those with darkvision, magical aptitude, or Black Robe training can perceive it. This means a "moonless" night might actually be a night of peak dark magic, with Nuitari at full power overhead while everyone else sees only darkness.

## Current State (351 AC)

As the party arrived in Solace, **Lunitari** was waxing toward High Sanction. The red moon loomed large over the Vallenwood trees, casting a crimson hue over the city.

## Wizards We've Seen

**Raistlin Majere** wears **Red Robes**, marking him as a wizard of Lunitari — a mage of neutral alignment who walks the line between light and darkness. His power waxes with the red moon.
