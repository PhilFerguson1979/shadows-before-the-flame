A rising military force threatening all of Krynn. Dragons have returned — and they have brought an army with them.

## What We Know

The Dragon Army is a massive military force that has begun conquering territory across Krynn. Details are scarce, but from **Ispin Greenshield's letter** and **Hederick's interrogation**, we have learned:

- **Dragons** — long believed extinct or mythical — have returned and serve as weapons of war
- The army uses **the Seekers** as puppet authorities in occupied towns, maintaining control without open military presence
- They are **collecting magical artifacts** and relics through the Seekers, confiscating them under the guise of religious law
- They fund their operations partly through a **slave trade**, selling captured people into bondage
- Their reach extends far beyond Solace — the occupation is part of a much larger campaign
