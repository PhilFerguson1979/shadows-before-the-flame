# The Blue Crystal Staff

A mysterious artifact that seems to channel genuine divine healing magic — something thought lost since the Cataclysm.

---

## What We Know

The Blue Crystal Staff is carried by **[Goldmoon](../npcs/goldmoon.md)**, a Plainsman woman who arrived at the Inn of the Last Home. The staff:

- Appears to channel **real healing magic** — true clerical power, not Seeker fakery
- Is made of blue crystal that **glows** with inner light
- Was the object **Hederick** was trying to seize when he stormed the inn
- Is clearly significant enough that the Seekers (and by extension the Dragon Army) want it badly

## Why It Matters

Since the Cataclysm, the gods have been silent. No true clerical magic has existed in Krynn for centuries. The Seekers are frauds — they have no real divine power. If the Blue Crystal Staff truly channels divine healing, it could mean:

- The gods are returning
- There is a power that can stand against the Dragon Army
- Goldmoon may be the key to something much larger than anyone realizes

## Connection to Ispin's Warning

Ispin Greenshield's letter spoke of **artifacts of light** that must be protected against the rising darkness. The Blue Crystal Staff may be one of these artifacts.

## Unanswered Questions

- Where did Goldmoon get the staff?
- Which god (if any) does it channel?
- Is it one of the artifacts Ispin warned about?
- Why does the Dragon Army want it?
