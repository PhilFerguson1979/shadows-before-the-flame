## Summary

The party gathered in the treetop city of Solace, answering the call of their fallen friend Ispin Greenshield. At the Inn of the Last Home, innkeeper Otik Sandath delivered Ispin's final letter warning of a rising darkness. Before they could plan their next move, High Seeker Hederick and his guards stormed the inn — and all hell broke loose.

## What Happened

### Arrival at the Inn

The party arrived at the Inn of the Last Home, climbing the long staircase up the Vallenwood trunk into Solace's most beloved tavern. **Otik Sandath** greeted them and delivered **Ispin Greenshield's final letter** along with a **Robe of Useful Items**.

**Ispin's letter** warned of:
- A dark shadow reaching out from an abyss thought sealed forever
- Artifacts of light that must be protected
- The rise of the Dragon Army and the return of the old gods' servants

### The Confrontation

**Hederick the High Seeker** arrived with armed guards and **Sergeant Hagar**. He:
- Declared the party heretics and demanded they surrender
- Attempted to confiscate the **Blue Crystal Staff** carried by Goldmoon
- Ordered his guards to seize the party

### The Bar Fight

What followed was a chaotic, destructive brawl across the inn:

- **Dorthol** cast **Grease** on the floor to control the battlefield — then accidentally slipped on a cup and missed his intended area
- **Legolas** used his bow from an elevated position to pick off guards
- **Cerci** used nature magic (Thorn Whip) to drag enemies off balance
- **Darian** had a rough debut — failed most of his attack attempts, got his sword stuck in the table, and nearly died before the Monk saved him
- **Dwardo** inspired allies with Bardic Inspiration and caused chaos with Kender curiosity
- **Vomilia & Cogmaw** deployed their artificer inventions, adding mechanical firepower
- **Shoto** used martial arts to devastating effect — stunning strikes and rapid punches, took zero damage all fight (MVP)
- **Metallyn** critically failed her axe throw and lodged it in **Cerci's back** for 11 damage, then used her mace to bash Sergeant Hagar over the head, going into a fit of rage doing it
- **Tika Waylan** joined the fight wielding her frying pan
- **Caramon** threw Hederick into his own guards

**Cogmaw** grabbed grease from the wall, threw it in **Sergeant Hagar's face**, and lit him on fire with his fire bolt invention — killing Hagar. The dead sergeant fell on a table, setting it ablaze. **Dorthol** then threw water on the grease fire, causing an **explosion** that damaged several party members. **Shoto** spotted the fire spreading and called out for help. **Tika** responded, grabbing flour bags from the kitchen and smothering the fire, saving the inn.

### Interrogation

After defeating the guards, the party interrogated **Hederick** and learned:
- The **Seekers** answer to the **Dragon Army**
- They confiscate magical relics and artifacts under orders from above
- People are being **sold into slavery** to fund the Dragon Army's war effort
- The occupation of Solace is part of a much larger campaign

### The Escape

The party fled the inn and made their way through Solace's elevated walkways. While escaping:
- They spotted **dragons on the horizon** — confirming Ispin's warnings
- They reached **the Great Lift** but found the path **blocked**
- The session ended with the party trapped, needing to find another way out of Solace
