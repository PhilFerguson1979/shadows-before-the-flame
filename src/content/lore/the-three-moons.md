# The Three Moons of Krynn

Three moons cross the sky of Krynn, each tied to a different magical order:

| Moon | Color | Order | God |
|------|-------|-------|-----|
| Solinari | White | Good | Paladine |
| Lunitari | Red | Neutral | Gilean |
| Nuitari | Black | Evil (invisible to non-dark mages) | Takhisis |

A mage's power waxes and wanes with their moon. When their moon is high, spells are stronger. When it is absent, power weakens.
