# Krynn

The world of Krynn is the setting for the Shadows Before The Flame campaign. A world of high fantasy, ancient gods, and dragon-fueled war.

Krynn is home to the continent of **Ansalon**, where the campaign takes place. The gods of Krynn are divided into three orders — good, neutral, and evil — represented by the three moons that cross the sky: **Solinari** (white, good), **Lunitari** (red, neutral), and **Nuitari** (black, evil, visible only to dark mages).

The world is currently in the grip of the **War of the Lance** — the Dragon Army's invasion of Ansalon under the banner of the goddess **Takhisis**, the Queen of Darkness.
