# Ispin Greenshield

A seasoned adventurer and trusted friend whose parting words set us on the path we now walk.

## Ispin's Final Letter

Delivered by **Otik Sandath** at the Inn of the Last Home, Ispin's letter spoke of unease that had followed him into his final days — a wrongness in the world he couldn't name but couldn't ignore.

He warned of:

- A strange *pulling* in the world, as if time itself were being forced backward by unseen hands
- A Shadow reaching out from an Abyss thought long sealed
- **Artifacts of ancient light** finding their way to those who need them — which must not fall into the wrong hands
- A fragile peace that may not hold

His words were a farewell, but also a call to action — sharp hearts, steady hands, and watchful eyes.

Along with the letter, Ispin left the party a **Robe of Useful Items** — his practical parting gift, held in trust by Otik.

## Legacy

Ispin could not be here to face what is coming. But his foresight, his trust, and his gifts continue to travel with us. His warning has proven accurate in ways we are only beginning to understand.

## Unanswered Questions

- How did Ispin die?
- How did he learn about the rising darkness?
- What specific artifacts was he referring to?
- Did he have allies beyond our party who are also working against the threat?
