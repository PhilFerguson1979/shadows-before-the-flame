# The Seekers

The Seekers present themselves as a religious authority across Ansalon, filling the void left by the disappearance of the old gods.

## The Truth

Under interrogation, Hederick revealed that the Seekers are working directly for the **Dragon Army**:

- They confiscate magical items and relics from the populace on Dragon Army orders
- They sell civilians into slavery to fund the Dragon Army's war effort
- They travel city to city keeping populations compliant until the army arrives
- They are led locally by figures like **Hederick the High Seeker** in Solace
