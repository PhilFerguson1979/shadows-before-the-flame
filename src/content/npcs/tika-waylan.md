# Tika Waylan

**Role:** Barmaid | **Disposition:** Friendly

Wild curly red hair, eyes full of weary fire. Quick, tough, doesn't back down.

## Session 1 Events

- Shoved by Hederick when she tried to intervene.
- **Saved the Inn of the Last Home from burning down** — smothered the grease fire with flour bags after Shoto called for help. Without her, the Vallenwood tree could have gone up in flames.

## Relationship to Party

**Allied.** Stood up to Hederick at personal risk. Saved the inn.
