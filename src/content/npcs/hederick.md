# Hederick the High Seeker

**Role:** High Seeker of Solace | **Disposition:** Hostile | **First Seen:** Session 1

A pompous, drunken zealot with an oily voice and greedy eyes. Authority borrowed, not earned.

## What We Know

Hederick holds authority over Solace as its High Seeker. Under interrogation he revealed:

- The **Dragon Army pays the Seekers** to confiscate magical items.
- The Seekers **sell people into slavery** on behalf of the Dragon Army.
- Seekers keep towns compliant until the Dragon Army arrives.
- He invoked the name **Lord Verminaard** as his superior.

## Session 1 Events

- Stormed the Inn of the Last Home demanding Goldmoon's **Blue Crystal Staff**.
- Shoved Tika Waylan. Triggered the bar fight.
- All guards killed. Sergeant Hagar slain by arrow.
- **Captured, interrogated, looted, and left alive** — thoroughly humiliated.

## Relationship to Party

**Hostile.** Knows what we look like. Will not forget this.
