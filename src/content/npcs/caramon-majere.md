# Caramon Majere

**Role:** Warrior | **Disposition:** Friendly (observed)

Massive, powerfully built. Booming laugh. Warm despite his intimidating size.

## Session 1 Events

- Was eating Otik's spiced potatoes when Hederick arrived.
- **Threw Hederick bodily into his own guards** when Hederick shoved Tika.

## Relationship to Party

Not formally introduced, but clearly on the side of the inn's defenders.
