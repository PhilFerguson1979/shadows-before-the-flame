## Class Features

- **Martial Arts** (d4) — use DEX for unarmed strikes and monk weapons; bonus unarmed strike after Attack action
- **Unarmored Defense** — AC = 10 + DEX mod + WIS mod *(only when wearing no armor or shield)*

> 🥋 Current unarmored AC = **17** (10 + 4 DEX + 3 WIS). Never wear armor — this beats heavy plate!

## Session Highlights

### Session 1 — The Inn of the Last Home ⭐ MVP
- Opened with a **Natural 20** on Hederick
- **Killed 4 guards** — quarterstaff, kicks, and palm strikes
- Took **zero damage** — only party member untouched
- **Called out the grease fire**, Tika responded with flour and saved the inn
- Age 10. Youngest player. Best performance. **Session 1 MVP.**
