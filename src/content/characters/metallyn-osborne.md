## Class Features

- **Rage** (2/long rest) — Resistance to B/P/S damage, advantage on STR checks & saves, +2 melee damage
- **Unarmored Defense** — AC = 10 + DEX mod + CON mod *(only when wearing no armor)*

> ⚔️ Current unarmored AC = **14** (10 + 2 DEX + 2 CON). Wearing armor disables this — usually not worth it.

## Session Highlights

### Session 1 — The Inn of the Last Home
- **Critically failed** her axe throw — lodged it in Cerci's back for **11 damage**
- **Bashed Sergeant Hagar** for **7 damage**, going into Rage
- Took **4 damage** from Hagar's hammer and **3 damage** from grease fire
- Ended the session **covered in flour**
