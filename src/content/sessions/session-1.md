## What Happened

### Arrival at the Inn

The party climbed the long staircases of Solace's Vallenwood city and arrived at the Inn of the Last Home. **Otik Sandath** delivered **Ispin Greenshield's final letter** — and a mysterious **Robe of Useful Items**.

Ispin's letter warned of a rising darkness tied to a sealed abyss, artifacts of light that must be protected, and shadowy forces working through legitimate institutions.

### The Confrontation

**Hederick the High Seeker** arrived with armed guards and **Sergeant Hagar**, demanding Goldmoon's **Blue Crystal Staff**. When he shoved Tika Waylan, **Caramon Majere** threw Hederick into his own guards — and the fight was on.

### The Bar Fight

Combat was chaotic, creative, and explosively memorable. Shoto killed four guards without taking a scratch. Cogmaw turned a grease slick into a funeral pyre for Sergeant Hagar. Legolas put the finishing arrow through Hagar's skull. Meanwhile Dorthol turned a fire situation into an explosion, Metallyn's axe found Cerci's back instead of a guard, and Dwardo took himself out of the fight by bouncing off the ceiling.

Shoto noticed the grease fire spreading and called for help — Tika Waylan reacted instantly, smothering the flames with flour bags and saving the inn.

### Interrogation

After capturing Hederick, the party interrogated him. **Vomilia's intimidation** worked — Hederick broke and confirmed the Seekers are working with the Dragon Army, confiscating magical items and selling people into slavery. He invoked the name **Lord Verminaard**.

### Escape

The party fled through Solace's elevated walkways with Hederick as a prisoner. On the horizon: **dragons**. They reached the Great Lift — and found it blocked.
