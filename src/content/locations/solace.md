# Solace

**Region:** Abanasinia | **Status:** Under Seeker Occupation

A city built high in the branches of massive **Vallenwood trees** — homes, shops, and taverns all constructed above the forest floor, connected by rope bridges and wooden stairs.

## Current Situation

Solace is under **Seeker occupation** led by **Hederick the High Seeker**. The Seekers confiscate magical items and sell people into slavery to fund the Dragon Army.

## Notable Locations

| Place | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Inn of the Last Home | Solace's most famous tavern, carved into a Vallenwood. Run by Otik Sandath. |
| Town Square | Central gathering area among the treetop platforms. |
| The Great Lift | Main lift connecting ground to canopy. Currently **blocked**. |
