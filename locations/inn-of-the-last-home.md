# Inn of the Last Home

**Location:** [Solace](solace.md), Abanasinia
**First Visited:** Session 1

---

## Overview

The Inn of the Last Home is Solace's most famous and beloved establishment, **carved into the trunk and branches of a massive Vallenwood tree**. It is the heart of the city's social life -- a place where travelers, locals, and adventurers gather under its warm glow.

## Atmosphere

The inn is a place of warmth and comfort amid uncertain times:

- The air is thick with the smell of **spiced potatoes and aged ale**
- **Polished vallenwood tables** gleam under the light of **hanging lanterns**
- A **great hearth** dominates the main room, its fire crackling against the cool night air
- The wood of the tree itself forms the walls, ceiling, and floor -- smooth and warm to the touch

## Staff

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| [Otik Sandath](../npcs/otik-sandath.md) | Owner and innkeeper. Famous for his spiced potatoes. |
| [Tika Waylan](../npcs/tika-waylan.md) | Barmaid. Red-haired, brave, quick on her feet. |

## Session 1 Events

- The party arrived at the inn and was greeted by **Otik Sandath**, who delivered **Ispin Greenshield's final letter** and the **Robe of Useful Items** -- the legacy of their fallen friend.
- **[Hederick the High Seeker](../npcs/hederick.md)** stormed in with guards and **Sergeant Hagar**, attempting to seize **[Goldmoon's](../npcs/goldmoon.md) Blue Crystal Staff**.
- A violent **bar fight** erupted. Hederick shoved **[Tika](../npcs/tika-waylan.md)**, prompting **[Caramon](../npcs/caramon-majere.md)** to throw the Seeker into his own guards.
- **Cogmaw** killed **Sergeant Hagar** by throwing grease in his face and lighting him on fire with his fire bolt invention. Hagar fell dead on a table, setting it ablaze. **Dorthol** threw water on the grease fire, causing an explosion. **Shoto** called out for help and **Tika** responded with flour bags, saving the inn from destruction.
- All of Hederick's guards were killed. Hederick was captured, interrogated, and left alive but humiliated.
- The party **escaped through the back** of the inn, fleeing into the elevated walkways of Solace.

## Significance

The Inn of the Last Home is where the party's adventure truly began. It is where Ispin's warning was delivered, where the Seeker conspiracy was first revealed, and where the party first crossed paths with the companions who carry the Blue Crystal Staff.
