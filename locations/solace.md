# Solace

**Region:** Abanasinia
**First Visited:** Session 1

---

## Overview

Solace is a city unlike any other -- built high in the branches of massive **Vallenwood trees**. Homes, shops, taverns, and walkways are all constructed above the forest floor, connected by a web of **rope bridges, wooden stairs, and elevated platforms**. The city is reached from the ground by **great lifts** that haul people and goods up into the canopy.

The Vallenwood trees themselves are ancient and enormous, their trunks wide enough to carve buildings into and their branches strong enough to support entire neighborhoods. Life in Solace happens in the treetops, with the forest floor far below.

## Current Situation

Solace is currently under **Seeker occupation**. The Seekers -- led locally by **[Hederick the High Seeker](../npcs/hederick.md)** -- serve as a religious and civil authority, but their true allegiance appears to lie with the **Dragon Army**. They confiscate magical items and sell people into slavery to fund the war effort.

## Notable Locations

| Place | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Inn of the Last Home](inn-of-the-last-home.md) | Solace's most famous tavern, carved into a massive Vallenwood tree. Run by Otik Sandath. |
| Town Square | A central gathering area among the treetop platforms. |
| The Great Lift | The main lift system connecting the ground to the treetop city. Currently **blocked** -- the party could not use it to escape. |
